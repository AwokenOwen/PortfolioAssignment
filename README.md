# Portfolio Assignment 
My submission for my portfolio assignment

# What I Did
My role in this project was to make the camera system and create the sound effects/music. During this project, I had to rewrite the camera system to fit the game better. I felt the camera system was more important to the build than the sound effects so I spent more time tweaking and then rewriting the camera system before getting the necessary sound effects.

# Challenges
The first challenge I faced while making the camera system was raycasting/line tracing in Unreal. In the old camera system, a line trace was made between the camera and the player. If the line trace hits the camera is then put in an algorith that chooses the closest camera with the highest priority. The first problem with this was that the player controllers were not part of the correct layer for the line trace this took awhile to figure out and change the line trace to be able to see the player controller.
The next challenge was placing camera angles
